# Rummy-500-Scorepad
Android Basics Nanodegree - Project 2 Score Keeper

This project is a simple app for keeping score of a game of your choice. I went beyond the requirements of this project after submitting, because I wanted to improve it for publishing. Here is the link for it on the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catielynn.android.rummy500scorepadapp

This project utilizes the following (requirements):
- Buttons for adding and subtracting score amounts
- Reset button that applies to all scores
- Displays different groups of buttons for different players/teams
- Background image (need to go back and add multiple densities)

This project also utilizes the following (beyond scope):
- EditText fields for player names
- Options for 2-4 players
- Toast message for winner
- Displays and increments round number accordingly
